This repository contains the codebase of the [CVPR24 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Dunkel_Normalizing_Flows_on_the_Product_Space_of_SO3_Manifolds_for_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf) "Normalizing Flows on the Product Space of SO(3) Manifolds for Probabilistic Human Pose Modeling", where we introduce HuProSO3, a normalizing flow model that operates on a high-dimensional product space of SO(3) manifolds, modeling the distribution of human joint rotations.

This repository includes code for training and evaluation of the pre-trained models for unconditional prior and pose estimation from 2D or 3D keypoints.



## Usage

### Installation Instructions

In your prefered environment, install all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then, install the `hp` library via ```pip install .```

We use [Body Visualizer](https://github.com/nghorbani/body_visualizer/) for rendering of humans. Follow their instructions for installations if this functionality is desired.

### Preprocessing of Data
- Download the AMASS data from the [official homepage](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/).
- Extract the data using `bash scripts/extract_amass_datasets.sh`.
- Preprocess the data using `bash scripts/preprocess_amass_data.sh`.


### Training
The unconditional prior can be trained using `python scripts/train_prior.py`.
Training of the model inverse kinematics, i.e. 3D keypoints to SMPL joint rotations, can be performed via `python scripts/train_SO3_ik.py`.
For training with 2D keypoint condition, assign `conditioning.conditioning_modality='2D'` in `config/config.yaml`. For randomly masking the condition during training, set `conditioning.mask=true`.



### Inference and Results
Model inference and example evaluations are illustrated in `explore/evaluate.ipynb`.
